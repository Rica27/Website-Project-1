# Website-Project-1
This is my first website project for my website on Lingerie and Swim wear for my Internet Business Technologies Class at Georgetown University. A requirement for my school project that has spiked my interest innWebsite Designing.
This is not my best work but I am willing to continue with it to get one of the best project.
This website is targeted to ladies and men. I am a fun of lingerie and I believe lingeries and swim wears are some things women should take time and invest in. Very good lingerie and swim wear last longer and also boost your confidence. So, if men want to surprise their girlfriends and or wives, I just gave you an important TEA!
I mostly used youtube videos and w3 schoolsfor this work. 
For my signin, I used a template from Formspree. Then I continued to incorporate a template from W3 schools to modify it.

The youtue videos that were of help to me included:

As I practiced with these videos, i became comfortable and that helped me to design the website as I preferred.
My regret is, I am unable to find a code that will help me place the images description beneath the images. I was only able to put it by their side. But as I said, I will continue to work on it and if I find any helpful video or cheatsheet, I will add it to my "Planning/Readme file for other users to utilize.
I will like to say thank you to Professor Michael Rossetti of Georgetown for teaching and posting notes and videos and giving me the opportunity to start a website on my own and also to Ms. Sara Alkhodair, a colleague in the Internet Business Technology Class of Georgetown Universtiy for answering my messages and calls on other questions I had no answers to.
PRACTICE INDEED MAKES ONE PERFECT! LET'S GO!!
